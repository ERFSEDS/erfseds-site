Elected to lead Pathfinder IX, his team went on to get 2nd place at the FAR 1030 competition in Mojave California and was one of the most successful Pathfinder rockets in recent years. Hailing from Johnstown Pennsylvania, his passion for spaceflight comes from many nights stargazing as a kid, pondering the countless number of things yet to be discovered outside our little bubble of existence. When his FIRST Robotics team, Westytek, was started at his high school; he discovered his passion for engineering and decided to combine his love for spaceflight and engineering into becoming an Aerospace Engineer.
